Long time to go, but my goal is make `caketable` be able to tranform between any table format.

## Installation
TODO

## Transformations supported
- [x] csv to Markdown table
- [ ] Markdown table to csv

You can request for new transformation by creating new issue. Pull Requests are definitely welcome!

## Usage
```bash
caketable input.csv output.md

# You can also write the output into stdout
caketable input.csv output.md --stdout
```
